				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that people can trick users with dark pattern by changing the UI/UX design. Dark pattern doesn't occur only on web designs, it can be anywhere, even bank statements. There are 11 types of dark patterns that have been categorized. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I like how there are very good examples for each of the dark patterns. I have seen a lot of websites do something that is listed to trick users. Some of them are so commonly seen that it is almost not a "dark pattern" anymore. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Good user experience design is about providing the users with seamless, enjoyable interactions with products. It has the userâ€™s best interest in mind, and is not deceptive or sneaky in nature." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
