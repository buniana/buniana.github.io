						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that I need to consider what the purpose the fonts serve and what the users are before deciding which fonts to go with. I also learned that I should use no more than 3 differents fonts on one design. Finally, I learned that there are a lot of resources we can use to find suitable fonts for our designs.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like the font size part the best. Since I usually choose whatever font sizes I like, it is interesting to know that there is a rule we can follow to determine font sizes. It minimizes the work a lot! I also like how the article provided tons of resources to find good fonts and good pairings of fonts. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
