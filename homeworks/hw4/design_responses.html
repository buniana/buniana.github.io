					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that considering accessibility is important in design. For some federal agencies, it is illegal to have websites that do not follow the accessibility guidelines. I also learned that considering accessibility early in the design process as well as having a design system to make sure everyone on the team is on the same page can be helpful. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like the part that talks about regulations on accessibility in web design. I have never thought about the importance of regulations especially for federal agencies. I also like the part that talks about the solutions other than color to ensure accessibility. The icons and patterns are very clever solutions, and the way the article presents them are very straight-forward. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "In 2017, plaintiffs filed at least 814 federal lawsuits about allegedly inaccessible websites, including a number of class actions. " </p>
