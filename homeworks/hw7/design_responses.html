					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that our brain can easily perceive objects in different persepectives and can make sense of things based on the things we've seen before. I also learned that UI design is not just about making things look pretty but also how the information can be the most effectively conveyed to the audience. The Gestalt principles include proximity, common region, similarity, closure, symmetry, continuation, and common fate. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really like the way each principle is presented. Each principle is followed by a short description and an image, which help me understood the principles. The color coding also made different sections separate. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Your brain is always trying to make sense of the world by comparing previous experiences or visual patterns and connecting the dots." </p>
						</li>
