					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the animation design should generally follow law of physics because users are expecting things to move according to how they already are in daily life. I also learned that the same duration and movement can be very different depending on what the animation curve looks like. Also, larger objects should move slower than smaller object. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like how the article has a lot of gif to demonstrate different animations. It makes the curves make a lot more sense. I also like the color scheme that was chosesn. Everything was either blue or red, which made it easier to watch the animations. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "The reason is simple: the size of the screen is bigger so objects overcome the longer path when they change position." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
