    <ul>
        <li>1. What is something you learned from this article? (2-3 sentences)<br>
        I learned that having hierarchy can guide the users. I also learned that it takes practice to have a eye for design.</li>

        <li>2. What was your favorite part of this article? (2-3 sentences)<br>
        I like the “Breaking down the app” part because it really allows me to look at these apps from a designer’s viewpoint instead of just a user’s viewpoint. The observations helped me think about why the designers made certain design choices and I started to pay more attention to how design choice can serve different functions.</li>

        <li>3. Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool.<br>
        “When I started off in design, I sucked.”</li>

        <li>4. On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.<br>
        I will give it a 9. It is pretty short and very easy to read. The only reason I took off one point is because I think it is a little bit hard to look at the deconstructed app first and then read the observations to get started with. I think it will be easier tor read if they can be side by side on the page.</li>
