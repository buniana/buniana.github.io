                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> There can be very cool transitions added to UI designs. Also, adding these interactions make the UI very satisfying to watch. It invites the people to interact with the page more.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I like that they included both web and app designs. I think it made me realized that it is easier to get very minimalist interaction deign on mobile app. The interaction designs on a webpage tend to be more clustered.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The PRISM one is my favorite. It brings new content in a very continuous way as you scroll down the screen. The way the contents get presented makes it easy for people to follow along. Especially at the end when the "make an appointment" showed up, it emphasizes what they want you to do. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 7. I wish I can have something to read. Looking at the inspirations alone made me a little bit lost what I am supposed to get out of the page. </p>
